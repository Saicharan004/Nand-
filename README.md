# Nand-Flash-Memory
INTRODUCTION
As a semiconductor memory device capable of 
nonvolatile data storage even after removing the power 
supply, NAND flash has gained popularity in a variety of 
applications, like removable memory cards for portable 
devices, MP3 players, digital still cameras, and mobile 
handsets. The emerging multi-media applications demand for 
higher density and lower cost/MB, and drive the continuous 
process technology shrink and the MLC (multi level cell) 
technology adoption. Nevertheless, the narrower line pitch 
due to process technology shrink may induce severer cross 
interference between memory cells. No matter the 
requirement for multiple energy states also leaves MLC 
technology with a lower margin of error to read the bits. 
Since the NAND flash is operated through page (e.g. 2 
Kbytes) programming and block (e.g. 128 Kbytes) erasing to 
satisfy the fast data transfer rate for mass data storage, an 
intrinsic random bit error makes the whole block be marked
