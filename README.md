# Nand-Flash-Memory
INTRODUCTION
As a semiconductor memory device capable of          
nonvolatile data storage even after removing the power
supply, NAND flash has gained popularity in a variety of
applications, like removable memory cards for portable
devices, MP3 players, digital still cameras, and mobile
handsets. The emerging multi-media applications demand for
higher density and lower cost/MB, and drive the continuous
process technology shrink and the MLC (multi level cell)
technology adoption. Nevertheless, the narrower line pitch
due to process technology shrink may induce severer cross
interference between memory cells. No matter the
requirement for multiple energy states also leaves MLC
technology with a lower margin of error to read the bits.
Since the NAND flash is operated through page (e.g. 2
Kbytes) programming and block (e.g. 128 Kbytes) erasing to
satisfy the fast data transfer rate for mass data storage, an
intrinsic random bit error makes the whole block be marked
as “bad” and can no longer be utilized. Once the number of
bad blocks exceeds a certain value that the controller chip
can manage, the NAND flash chip is declared fail. A NAND
Controller is required to handle the bit errors, the bad blocks,
maintaining the high data accessing speed, flash memory
management, etc. The appropriateness of a NAND controller
can enhance the reliability and increase the endurance cycles
of the flash memory. In addition, the system performance
and product lifetime can also be improved by incorporating
an excellent NAND Flash Controller in the NAND Flash
Storage Systems.
The Systolic Array architecture has been applied to the
regular and iterative VLSI architecture, like RS encoders and
decoders, and showed good performance [10]. The
systematic design approach of a Systolic Array Processor
can make the circuit design easy for implementation and do
the pipelining to fit the system level design specifications. In
this paper, we presented a t-EC w-bit Parallel BCH ECC
code with incorporating the Systolic Array architecture. The
good performances were shown by the real chip realization.
THE CONTROLLER ARCHITECTURE
The functional block diagram of the NAND Flash
Controller was shown in Figure 1. The major functions of the
Controller can be divided as: the t-EC w-bit Parallel BCH
ECC Circuit, the Code-Banking structure and Firmware In-
System Programmable (ISP), the Defect Management and
Wear-leveling Algorithm, and the Dual Channel and Multi-
Buffering mechanism. The ECC Circuit was designed here to
enhance the data integrity and reliability of the data stored in
the Flash memory. The Code-banking structure for the
Micro-controller complying with firmware ISP function can
provide the firmware upgrade to support various kind of
Flash memory. The Defect Management Algorithm can
increase the yield of the Flash memory and prolong the
product life cycle by replacing the defected (Bad) block with
the reserved virgin (clean data) blocks. The Wear-leveling
Algorithm was also introduced to prolong the product life
cycle by preventing the Flash memory blocks from un-balanced usage. The Dual Channel and Multi-Buffering
mechanism was designed to increase the data transfer rate at
the Flash memory side and to fit the maximum bandwidth of
the host-side interface bus.
